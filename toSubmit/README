Build Instructions

To build the parser, type "make" in the current directory, which will 
generate an executable program called "Main".

  To test source code like "1.cm", type 

    "java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Main 1.cm" 

and the syntax tree will be displayed on the screen.

  To rebuild the parser, type "make clean" and type "make" again.

Test Instructions

To test the error handling run the following line on files [1,2,3,4,5].cm

    "java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Main 1.cm" 

We have tested our program with the provided tiny files from the assignment package "C1-Package.tgz".
