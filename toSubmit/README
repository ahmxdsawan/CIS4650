Build Instructions

To build the parser, type "make" in the current directory, which will 
generate an executable program called "Main".

  To test source code like "1.cm", type 

    "java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Main 1.cm" 

and the syntax tree will be displayed on the screen.

  To rebuild the parser, type "make clean" and type "make" again.
